PART
{
// this is a sample config file, for determining a good file format for defining part parameters
// comment line - ignored by cfg parser
// empty lines, or lines without a '=' sign are also ignored
// all other lines are split at the '=' sign, and the left operand is used to know what parameter we are setting
// diferent parameters require data in different formats (see docs), and each module has it's own parameters (again, see docs)
// each assignment must be in a single line. Lines without assignments will be ignored. (You CAN turn on word wrap, though)
// each keyword here relates to an existing variable in the assigned module. If the keyword isn't found, it is ignored.
// conversely, if a keyword is left unassigned (as in not in the file), it will be initialized with it's default value
// This is done automatically, so any public variable defined in the loaded module can be accessed this way (provided it's value can be parsed)

description = The Scimitar is a new engine that revolutionised a surprising number of things- high-temperature materials manufacture, high-strength materials manufacture, high-speed materials manufacture, and styrofoam cup manufacture. Anyway, down to the nitty gritty. It is basically a mixture of aerospike and rapier. It looks better than either of them too (though some disagree). Oh, and it has vacuum nozzles for a high vacuum efficiency.
